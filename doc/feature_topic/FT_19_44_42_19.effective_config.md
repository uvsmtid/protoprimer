To make it easily comprehensible, the `protoprimer` supports `--config` option to print annotated effective config:
*   annotated: each config option is printed with its description and derived values
*   effective: all fields are shown with their final values (with defaults applied)

This feature is planned to replace `--wizard` mode (see [FT_32_54_11_56.wizard_mode.md][FT_32_54_11_56.wizard_mode.md]) which is:
*   less convenient: the user has to navigate via CLI dialogue)
*   more confusing: the modification is done on the initial values without seeing the derived ones
*   more cumbersome: it writes to the config files (not read-only) which include nested `dict`-s and `list`-s
