To make it easily comprehensible, the `protoprimer` supports `config` option to print annotated effective config:
*   annotated: each config option is printed with its description
*   effective: all fields are shown with their values (if present) including final derived ones

The effective config uses `python` format (to render comments):
*   for all loaded files in JSON (see [FT_48_62_07_98.config_format.md][FT_48_62_07_98.config_format.md])
*   and also for [FT_00_22_19_59.derived_config.md][FT_00_22_19_59.derived_config.md]

This obsoleted interactive wizard mode which was:
*   less convenient: the user has to navigate via CLI dialogue
*   more confusing: the modification is done on the initial values without seeing the derived ones
*   more cumbersome: it writes to the config files (not read-only) complicated with nested `dict`-s and `list`-s
