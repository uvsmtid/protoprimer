## Intro

There are three (3) configuration leaps used by [FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md][FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md].

Essentially, going through all the conf leaps is the way to load all the config info.

## Ordering

Information from the prev leap specifies how to find the next one.

Configuration leaps are ordered (from first to last).

*   `leap_input`

    This info is provided before path to the file with `proto_conf` is found.

    It may only from command line args, env vars, or hard-coded values.

    See [FT_02_89_37_65.shebang_line.md][FT_02_89_37_65.shebang_line.md].

*   `leap_primer`

    This is provided by `proto_conf`.

*   `leap_client`

    This leap provides client-specific configurations.

*   `leap_env`

    This leap provides environment-specific configurations.

    It only makes sense to distinguish `leap_env` from `leap_client` when there are more than one environment
    client code needs to deal with.

    This is also the leap that gives access to `source_local` config.
    See also [FT_23_37_64_44.conf_dst.md][FT_23_37_64_44.conf_dst.md].

## Configuration files

Depending on the [FT_59_95_81_63.env_layout.md][FT_59_95_81_63.env_layout.md], all configuration leaps
may be provided in a single file or separate ones.
