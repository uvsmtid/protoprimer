topic_title: config format
topic_status: TODO
---

A list of conditions to select acceptable config format:
*   No external dependencies (dropping any YAML or even TOML because of older `python` versions < 3.11).
*   No executable code (dropping `*.py` because of security concerns).

This leaves only JSON (even though it does not support comments).

Nevertheless, `protoprimer` does not need very complex config data, therefore, using JSON is practical enough.

At the same time, each field is described using annotated
[FT_19_44_42_19.effective_config.md][FT_19_44_42_19.effective_config.md] which renderrs JSON in `python` format
(allowing comments).
