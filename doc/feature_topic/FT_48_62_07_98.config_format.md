topic_title: config format

List of conditions for config format:
*   No external dependencies (dropping any YAML or even TOML because of older `python` versions < 3.11).
*   No executable code (dropping `*.py` because of security concerns).

This leaves us with JSON only (even though it does not support comments).

Nevertheless, `protoprimer` does not need complex config data, therefore, using JSON is practical enough.
