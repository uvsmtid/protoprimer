Normally, `protoprimer` supports two Python versions:
*   `min`: earliest **possible** to test
*   `max`: latest one

It does not mean `protoprimer` cannot run with other versions - it simply means:
*   no tests run for versions other than `min` and `max` ones
*   changes to support versions earlier than the `min` one are **still accepted but breakable**

Supporting versions earlier than `min` is mainly limited by available resources with those versions.
For example, github.com retires runners with EOL versions - diff these jobs to see the current test config:
*   [min python test][min_python_test]
*   [max python test][max_python_test]

See current status:
https://devguide.python.org/versions/

To roll `python` versions, use this `feature_story` tag to find (or mark) all places for update.
