With no args, the only way to override defaults is to use env vars.

They can also be configured in [FT_02_89_37_65.shebang_line.md][FT_02_89_37_65.shebang_line.md].

## Supported env vars

*   `PROTOPRIMER_STDERR_LOG_LEVEL`

    It holds a `str` value for the constant named as defined by `logging` module.

    For example, value `INFO` refers to `loggint.INFO`.
