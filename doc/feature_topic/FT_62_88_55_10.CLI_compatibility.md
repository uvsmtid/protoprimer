This doc applies to the case when `protoprimer` is used as bootstrap app - see [FT_93_57_03_75.app_vs_lib.md][FT_93_57_03_75.app_vs_lib.md].

## CLI compatibility for bootstrap app

Bootstrap process requires CLI compatibility to transition to `neo` runtime [FT_14_52_73_23.primer_runtime.md][FT_14_52_73_23.primer_runtime.md].

When [FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md] switches between
[FT_14_52_73_23.primer_runtime.md][FT_14_52_73_23.primer_runtime.md] (see `run_main` command),
they must implement the same command line interface (CLI) (to handle the same set of args).
Otherwise, they will behave differently.

From the user point of view (as exposed via CLI), the script will appear identical in both cases.
