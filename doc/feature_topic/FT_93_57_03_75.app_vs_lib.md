## Intro

[FT_90_65_67_62.proto_kernel.md][FT_90_65_67_62.proto_kernel.md] is designed to run without `venv`.

This makes it useful for scripts not as a primer (bootstrapper) application,
but also as an initial library for basic functionality before `venv` is available.

## `proto_kernel`: app vs lib

*   app = application

    This means that the [FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md] being executed
    is meant to traverse [FT_68_54_41_96.state_dependency.md][FT_68_54_41_96.state_dependency.md] in
    one of the [FT_11_27_29_83.run_mode.md][FT_11_27_29_83.run_mode.md].

    Effectively, the script has to execute `main` function from `proto_kernel`.

*   lib = library

    When `proto_kernel` is used as a library, the [FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md]
    typically relies on `delegate_to_venv` function eventually running its own business logic from deployed packages.

## `main` function and help on args

Ultimately, the symptom of the choice (whether `proto_kernel` is used as an app or a lib)
manifests itself in the help output that script provides (what set of args its `main` function expects):

```sh
path/to/script -h
```
