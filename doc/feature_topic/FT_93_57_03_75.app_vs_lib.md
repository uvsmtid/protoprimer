TODO: The significance of the difference between `app` vs `lib` has been obsolted by
[FT_58_74_37_70.starter_vs_bootstrapper.md][FT_58_74_37_70.starter_vs_bootstrapper.md] -
effectively, the `protoprimer` during `proto` runtime is used as `app` only
(either as env bootstrapper or app starter).

## Intro

[FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md][FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md] is designed to run without `venv`.

This makes it useful for scripts **not only** as a primer (bootstrapper) application,
but also as an initial library for basic functionality before `venv` is available.

## `proto_code`: app vs lib

*   app = application

    This means that the [FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md] being executed
    is meant to traverse [FT_68_54_41_96.state_dependency.md][FT_68_54_41_96.state_dependency.md] in
    one of the [FT_11_27_29_83.run_mode.md][FT_11_27_29_83.run_mode.md].

    Effectively, the script has to execute `main` function from `proto_code`.

*   lib = library

    When `proto_code` is used as a library, the [FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md]
    typically relies on `switch_to_venv` function eventually running its own business logic from deployed packages.

## `main` function and help on args

Ultimately, the symptom of the choice (whether `proto_code` is used as an app or a lib)
manifests itself in the help output that script provides (what set of args its `main` function expects):

```sh
path/to/script -h
```

The reason for that is required [FT_62_88_55_10.CLI_compatibility.md][FT_62_88_55_10.CLI_compatibility.md].
