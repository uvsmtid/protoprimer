## Intro

In the context of `protoprimer`, there are few persistent configuration destinations:

*   `source_shebang` configuration is stored into [FT_02_89_37_65.shebang_line.md][FT_02_89_37_65.shebang_line.md] (related to `proto_code`).

*   `source_global` configuration is stored into a config file common to all deployment (related to `ref_root`).

*   `source_local` configuration is stored into environment files (related to `local_env`).

Config dst is closely related to [FT_89_41_35_82.conf_leap.md][FT_89_41_35_82.conf_leap.md].

Essentially, the dst only manifests itself in the selection of the file to contain the information.
