topic_title: state idempotency
topic_status: TODO

Each state value is treated as idempotent (re-evaluation/re-bootstrapping of state value must yield the same value).

Because of that (for optimization), the evaluated value may be cached.
Caching ensures idempotency "de facto" (at least, within current `python` process),
nevertheless, it must be followed "de jure" because `proto_kernel` re-starts itself using
different [FT_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md][FT_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md].

If the state has to have different values evaluated for different moments withing [FT_57_87_94_94.bootstrap_process.md][FT_57_87_94_94.bootstrap_process.md],
this has to be two different states (different names) and implemented accordingly.

[FT_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md]: FT_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md
