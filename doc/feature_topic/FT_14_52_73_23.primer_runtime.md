## `protoprimer` execution runtimes

TODO: It seems like this concept of runtimes is redundant:
    -   [FT_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md][FT_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md] cover python exec transition
    -   [FT_89_41_35_82.conf_leap.md][FT_89_41_35_82.conf_leap.md] covers configuration discovery
    What does runtime explain?
    Whether control is transferred outside of implementation done by `protoprimer`.
    When does the transition from one runtime to another change?
    Execution of user code.

There are a few primer runtimes:

*   `proto` = independent (stand-alone)

    This runtime runs [FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md][FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md].

    It is designed to start outside of `venv` (or inside arbitrary `venv` without `protoprimer` package installed).

    Subsequently, it switches to initialized `venv` with installed `protoprimer` and
    runs `protoprimer.primer_kernel` module directly before switching to `neo` runtime eventually.

*   `neo`

    This runtime is client-specific (custom) setup that may perform any other setup (using packages in `venv`).

    *   `protoprimer` package only implements transition into that runtime (`proto` -> `neo`).

         But `protoprimer` does not implement `neo` states (they are out of its scope).

    *   `neoprimer` package implements states to be run in `neo` runtime.

        These states can be run as is or customized by the client code.

## Why do we need these runtimes?

The `proto` runtime must not import other non-standard packages (which are accessed via `venv` later) when it starts -
it runs a stand-alone [FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md][FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md]
(limited only to the states defined there).

Any client-specific states only become accessible in `neo` runtime which starts
another [FT_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md][FT_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md].

## How does transition from `proto` to `neo` runtimes work?

It relies on a helper function from [FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md][FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md]
used by the [FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md] -
see [FT_58_74_37_70.starter_vs_bootstrapper.md][FT_58_74_37_70.starter_vs_bootstrapper.md].

Depending on whether it is `venv` or not, the helper function passess control to different `selected_main`:
*   Outside `venv` with necessary packages, it executes `selected_main` from `proto_kernel`.
*   Inside `venv` with necessary packages, it executes `selected_main` from `client_code`.

It also requires [FT_62_88_55_10.CLI_compatibility.md][FT_62_88_55_10.CLI_compatibility.md].

## How to specify target state available only in `neo` runtime?
