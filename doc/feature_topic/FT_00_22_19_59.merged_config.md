topic_title: merged config

See:
*   [FT_23_37_64_44.conf_dst.md][FT_23_37_64_44.conf_dst.md] for global and local configs.
*   [FT_89_41_35_82.conf_leap.md][FT_89_41_35_82.conf_leap.md] for config leaps.

Any field in global can be overridden by a field in local config.
Instead of querying fields form global or local (and merging them somehow),
the `protoprimer` exposes merged config.

The merged config has a declared schema combining all the fields and adding derived ones.

To derive a merged field value, there are a couple of ways:
1.  either use the same field name and keep overriding the value (hiding the overridden one)
2.  or use different field names for original ones the overridden value (allowing querying all of them)

The reason for the 2nd one is flexibility:
*   for simple field values, overriding is a straight-forward (almost universal) strategy
*   for nested field values (e.g. `list` or `dict`), there can be multiple ways (override, combine, etc.)

Anyway, for now, the `protoprimer` uses the 1st approach for its simplicity.
