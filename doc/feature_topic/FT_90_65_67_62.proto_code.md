## Intro

If you start with an absolutely empty environment, there is nothing you can run.

To start running `protoprimer`, you need at least:
*   minimal [FT_22_11_94_65.bootstrap_precondition.md][FT_22_11_94_65.bootstrap_precondition.md]
*   `proto_code` (described now)

## What is `proto_code`?

`proto_code` is a **copy** of `protoprimer.primer_kernel` module
stored **together** with the client code in the client repo.

## How is `proto_code` started?

A user should be able to clone the client repo and prime the environment by a single command:

```sh
./prime
```

What the client does **not** want is to maintain any code outside the client-specific concerns.

What exactly is the command the user has to run (`./prime` or something else)
depends on the client configuration of:
*   [FT_59_95_81_63.env_layout.md][FT_59_95_81_63.env_layout.md]
*   [FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FT_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md]
