Entry script is a term describing a dummy script (few lines long without complex logic).
They serve as entry point to launch the rest of the code (which is supposed to be inside installed modules).

Entry scripts are executed as commands in shell and their `python` is (always) `PythonExecutable.py_exec_unknown`.
The main job for entry scripts is to "figure out" how to activate `venv` so that they can  pass the execution there.

Options for `venv` activation:
*   The fastest option is to use (generated) shebang pointing to `python` from `venv`.
*   A slower alternative is to run `delegate_to_venv` helper function from `proto_kernel.py`.
