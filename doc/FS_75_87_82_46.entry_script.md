## Definition

Entry script is a term describing the command user types into its shell to execute:

```sh
./path/to/script
```

## Clarification

A user may also start any **binary** executable that way, but in the context of `protoprimer`,
the phrase "entry script" narrows down specifically to those commands implemented as **text** scripts
primarily because they often have to be **very primitive** to create.

They serve two purposes:
*   they should be relatively easy for user to type
*   they should not do anything but delegate executing complex logic somewhere else

In short, they are **primitive delegators**.

## Why primitive delegators?

Entry scripts should be kept primitive because they are harder to test:
*   they are outside of `venv` and which makes their import cumbersome
*   they can be shell scripts which lack test-ability (see [FS_44_72_60_67.python_vs_shell.md][FS_44_72_60_67.python_vs_shell.md])

Ideally, they serve as only as an entry point to launch the rest of the code
(which is supposed to be inside `venv` as installed modules).

## How to delegate?

Entry scripts are started by the user shell and their `python` is unpredictable -
see [FS_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md][FS_72_45_12_06.python_executable.md].

The main job for entry scripts is to figure out how to delegate the execution to a module inside `venv`.

Options for `venv` activation:
*   The fastest option is to use (generated) shebang pointing to `python` from `venv`.
*   A slower alternative is to run `delegate_to_venv` helper function from [FS_90_65_67_62.proto_kernel.md].

## Special case: `proto_kernel`

It is possible to run `proto_kernel` as an entry script
(see min [FS_59_95_81_63.env_layout.md][FS_59_95_81_63.env_layout.md]), for example:

```sh
./prime
```

In that case, the internal logic is not exactly primitive.

However, because it is a copy of `protoprimer.primer_kernel`, the code is still easily test-able inside `venv`.
