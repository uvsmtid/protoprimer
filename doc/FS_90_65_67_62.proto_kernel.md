## Intro

If you start with an absolutely empty environment, there is nothing you can run.

To start running `protoprimer`, you need at least:
*   minimal [FS_22_11_94_65.bootstrap_precondition.md][FS_22_11_94_65.bootstrap_precondition.md]
*   `proto_kernel` (described now)

## What is `proto_kernel`?

`proto_kernel` is a **copy** of `protoprimer.primer_kernel` module stored **together** with the client code.

## How is `proto_kernel` started?

A user should be able to clone the client repo and prime the environment by a single command:

```sh
./prime
```

What the client does not want/need/have to maintain any code outside of the client-specific concerns.

What exactly is the command the user has to run depends on the client repo configuration of:
*   [FS_59_95_81_63.env_layout.md][FS_59_95_81_63.env_layout.md]
*   [FS_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FS_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md]
