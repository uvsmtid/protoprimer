This doc defines terms used in the vocabulary of `protoprimer` project.

---

<a id="entry_script"></a>

## "entry script"

See [FS_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FS_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md].

---

<a id="client_code"></a>

## "client code"

Phrase "client code" refers to the software project which relies on the `protoprimer` as a dependency.

---

<a id="client_root"></a>

## "client root"

This is the directory (base path) most of the paths are relative to.

It is important to know that:
*   "client root" may not be the same as "repo root" (although they are often the same).
*   "client root" may not be the same as "script dir".

See also:
*   "repo root"
*   "script dir"

---

<a id="client_root"></a>

## "main function"

This is just a pattern in `python` to factor `__main__` part into a `main` function -
see [more info][google_python_main_function].

---

<a id="proto_kernel"></a>

## "proto kernel"

`proto_kernel` is a **copy** of `protoprimer.primer_kernel` module stored **together** with the client code.

See [FS_90_65_67_62.proto_kernel.md][FS_90_65_67_62.proto_kernel.md].

---

<a id="repo_root"></a>

## "repo root"

The root directory of the repository with the client code.

See also:
*   "client root"

---

<a id="script_dir"></a>

## "script dir"

The `dirname` of the absolute path to the currently running script (without script `basename`).

This is the absolute path that allows keeping all other paths relative within the configuration.
