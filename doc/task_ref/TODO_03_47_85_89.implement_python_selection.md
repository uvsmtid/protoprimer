At the moment, `python` is selected via `ConfField.field_required_python_file_abs_path`
which can actually contain not only `abs` path, but also `rel` path, and basename.

The same applies to constants like `default_file_abs_path_python`.

Decide how python is selected and how to name the config fields.
