NOTE: Use `-S` option:
*   Shebang `#!/usr/bin/env NAME1=VALUE1 NAME2=VALUE2 exec` is interpreted by the kernel:
*   The kernel runs the `/usr/bin/env` but passess everything (`NAME1=VALUE1 NAME2=VALUE2 exec` as a single arg.
*   Specifically for that `env` has `-S` option to parse such single line from shebang.
*   Correct shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env -S NAME1=VALUE1 NAME2=VALUE2 exec`.

NOTE: There is a limit (potentially just 128 - 1 = 127 chars) for shebang.
It seems more portable & flexible to use entry script main body to set env vars there directly (instead of shebang).

Implement setting env vars in shebang on automatic proto_kernel update.
There are two parts:
*   list of env vars
*   specific python basename (to lookup in PATH)
