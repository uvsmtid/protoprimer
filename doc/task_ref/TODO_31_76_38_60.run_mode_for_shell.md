Maybe we need to refactor CLI?
*   Rename "run mode" concept to "exec mode" instead.
*   Rename `prime` mode to `boot` mode (still default).
*   Replace `--command` switch by `run` mode which executes whatever is passed on CLI or from `stdin`.
*   The new `run` ~~run~~ exec mode will be used for all executions in `shell`.
