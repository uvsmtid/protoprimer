## Intro

When [FS_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md][FS_75_87_82_46.entry_script.md] starts,
`python` executable is selected by the user shell.

That executable is unpredictable:
*   It may be any in the user `PATH` env var (via [FS_02_89_37_65.shebang_line.md][FS_02_89_37_65.shebang_line.md]).
*   It may be any specified by the user directly.

Moreover, once `venv` is initialized, [FS_90_65_67_62.proto_kernel.md][FS_90_65_67_62.proto_kernel.md] also needs
to switch to required `pythone` from that `venv` to run next phase (see [FS_14_52_73_23.primer_phase.md][FS_14_52_73_23.primer_phase.md]).

`proto_primer` switches progressively to next `python` binary via `os.execv`
communicating that progress via `ArgConst.arg_py_exec` arg.
