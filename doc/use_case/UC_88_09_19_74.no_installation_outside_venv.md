There is no (known) use case for `protoprimer` to be installed outside a `venv`.

In fact, the entire bootstrap process with all states imply `venv` usage.

Allowing it to be installed outside `venv` would also lead to come complications
of detecting `leap_primer` configuration (see [FT_89_41_35_82.conf_leap.md][FT_89_41_35_82.conf_leap.md]) -
its location is assumed to be in the same directory with stand-alone
[FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md][FT_90_65_67_62.proto_code.md] (not in the package installation directory).
