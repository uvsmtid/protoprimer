Do not obstruct but do not support installing stray packages.

A stray package is the one that is not listed as a dependency in `pyproject.toml` files.

Even if the main project should not depend on some package,
it is always possible to maintain a spec specifically for the environment - see [local_repo][local_repo_spec].
