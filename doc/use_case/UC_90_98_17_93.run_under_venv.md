## Problem

Even if `protoprimer` aims at starting without `venv` to initialize a `venv`,
it should work without issues when started under already activated `venv`
(regardless whether it is related or unrelated `venv`)
and initialize the required `venv`.

## Solution

When `venv` and path to `proto_code` was not specified,
switch out of this `venv` (escape) to the python (`sys.base_prefix`) used by this `venv`.

Actually, it should isolate itself not only from `venv` but from any deployed non-standard packages.
