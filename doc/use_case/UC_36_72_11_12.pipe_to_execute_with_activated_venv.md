Use should be able to execute `shell` commands in activated `venv`.

There are two (mutually exclusive) ways:

*   Specifying `--command` followed by a string arg (the string is to be interpreted by the `shell`).

    ```sh
    ./proto_code.py --command "exit 42"
    ```

*   Pipe-redirect output of a command to `stdin`.

    ```sh
    echo "exit 42" | ./venv_shell
    ```

The command is supposed to be executed in `shell` with activated `venv`.

See TODO_31_76_38_60.run_mode_for_shell.md:
NOTE: At the moment, `proto_code` alone does not allow pipe-redirect (it only works with `--command`).
In order to use pipe-redirect, use `venv_shell` from `neoprimer` module.
The difference comes from the fact that `proto_code` `prime` mode does not start shell without `--command`.
