## Intro

There are states and recipes for reaching that state.

This is a similar way how states are "bootstrapped" in other tools, for example:
*   [make][make_wiki]
*   [systemd][systemd_wiki]
*   ...

There is no domain-specific lang used by `protoprime` to define those states (everything is defined via `python` code).

## Identification

Each state is identified by a string (state name).

[FS_90_65_67_62.proto_kernel.md][FS_90_65_67_62.proto_kernel.md] defines states only
for "proto" phase (see [FS_14_52_73_23.primer_phase.md][FS_14_52_73_23.primer_phase.md]).

Client code may use that framework to implement client-specific states.

## Dependency: static and dynamic

States can depend on other states. These dependencies form a [DAG][DAG_wiki].

When child state (statically) depends on parent state,
parent state may or may not be (dynamically) bootstrapped before its child.

The dependencies are declared statically (before execution), but executed dynamically (conditionally):
*   NOTE: state implementation is free not to bootstrap any parent state (based on dynamic evaluation of conditions)
*   BUT: state implementation must not bootstrap any other state beyond statically declared as parent

Declaring dependencies statically allows ensuring there are no cycles (which break [DAG][DAG_wiki]).
